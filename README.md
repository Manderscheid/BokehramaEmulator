Bokehrama Emulation V1.0, 22.09.2020

The Bokehrama Emulation can create out of simple smartphone pictures with different sizes the associated Bokehramas. The directory to a folder containing images of the type JPG is the input.The standard input folder is the "images" folder already included. It contains several example pictures.

How to run:
Create a Conda environment with Python 3.7.
The requirements necessary to run can be found in the "requirements.txt".

The Bokehrama Emulation uses 2 Neural networks with pretrained models.

The semantic segmentation is done by the PSPNET_50 trained with ADE_20K dataset. The implementation from David Gupta
is available on Github:
https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras
Follow the instruction on the installation in the Github repository.

The depth estimation is realised by Monodepth2 which is also available on Github:
https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2

The Monodepth2 is already integrated in the Bokehrama Emulation Software, unlike the segmentation no installation is needed.

For further information on the Software take a look at the associated Thesis:
